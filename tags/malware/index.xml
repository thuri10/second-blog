      <description>What is RedLine Malware? Redline malware is an Information Stealer written in c# , targeting windows victims. It is used for gathering victims information ranging from the Browser cookies, saved credentials, Discord tokens, OS information, Languages, VPN profiles, Installed Programs and Network configurations.
The malware is also capable of downloading additional malware from its C2 servers.
Stage1 - Loader Analysis The first stage of sample malware is used for assembling and executing an additional payload.</description>

      <description>What is RemcosRat? RemcosRAT is a Fileless multi-stage malware that is distributed through malicious macros in Excel files. The malware enables remote administration of infected systems to perform unintended actions. This is a simple guide on understanding RemcosRat infection chain. The RemcosRAT infection can be described as shown in the image by @Unit 42.
 Infection Chain 
The infection chain start through phishing of the targets through mail services, the final payload of the infection chain is the used for communicating through TCP port 10174 as shown in the image.</description>

      <description>Challenge description.
 vm1.exe implements a simple 8-bit virtual machine (VM) to try and stop reverse engineers from retrieving the flag. The VM’s RAM contains the encrypted flag and some bytecode to decrypt it. Can you figure out how the VM works and write your own to decrypt the flag? A copy of the VM’s RAM has been provided in ram.bin (this data is identical to the ram content of the malware’s VM before execution and contains both the custom assembly code and encrypted flag).</description>

      <title>Static Analysis of Malware Strings</title>

      <description>This post is a brief walkthrough of &amp;ldquo;strings&amp;rdquo; challenges provided by MalwareTech. The challenges can be downloaded from the following website challenges.
The goal of &amp;ldquo;strings&amp;rdquo; challenges is to understand various implementation of strings in malware through static analysis. Strings are very useful in storing the configurations, decryption keys, data and c&amp;amp;c server addresses.
For analysis, I will use IDApro free for analysis. The author of the challenges provides a set of rules to follow while solving the challenges</description>
